This is a basic Markdown template, with no interpolations going on.

This should be

- predictable!

# Markdown template with imports and interpolations

We're importing foo, which is {{foo}}.

We're also adding a react component here: {{<Bar {...bat} style={{ foo: 'bar' }} />}}

This is a _Markdown Component_ file. Here you can include JSX-style assignment expressions; this component was generated using version {{ version }} of {{ name }}!

Props passed to this component are available as \`props\`, so you can embed those too! Hello there, {{ props.who || 'world' }}!

Another cool thing you can do is use JSX **directly** - hereâ€™s an SVG element, used inline: {{ <svg style={{ display: 'inline', height: '1em' }} viewBox="0 0 304 290"><path fill="none" stroke="currentColor" strokeWidth="16" d="M2,111 h300 l-242.7,176.3 92.7,-285.3 92.7,285.3 z" /></svg> }}.

  ``, // Test that empty input works as expected

  `This file is for testing interpolation inside other elements. <code>{{ window.navigator.userAgent }}</code>
